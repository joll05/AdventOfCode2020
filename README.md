# Advent Of Code 2020 Solutions
## :warning: Spoiler warning :warning:
Reading the solutions can reveal how to solve the puzzles. If you want to solve them yourself you might not want to read the code.

## Overview

This is a repository for my [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions.

All of my solutions are written in [python 3](https://python.org). They are often not very efficient, commented or well-written, because they are ususally somewhat quickly cobbled together.

## Folder structure
The solutions are orgianized into folders labelled `Day N`. Inside these folders there are usually these three files:
- `input.txt` - This is where the solutions will get the input from.
- `Solution1.py` - The solution code for the first part.
- `Solution2.py` - The solution code for the second part. This is usually copied from `solution1.py` and modified to fit the new requirements.

There may also be additional files/scipts if the puzzle requires it.
